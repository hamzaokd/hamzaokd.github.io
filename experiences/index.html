        <p>At iPepper, I gained valuable experience in data science and analytics. My initial responsibilities included statistical analysis and SQL, which allowed me to develop my data manipulation and management skills. </p>

            <p>As the internship progressed, I had the opportunity to work on a recruiting platform with my team. My role was to help develop a data-driven approach to identifying candidate-job matches by web scraping and cleaning data, and applying my knowledge of statistical analysis.</p>
            
            <p>In the process, I gained experience in Python, SQL, WebScraping, data cleaning and manipulation, NLP and Flask, which I used to develop solutions that allowed our team to analyze data and deliver actionable insights to our clients.</p>
                
            <p>Through this experience, I developed a deep understanding of the role that data science plays in developing innovative solutions to complex problems.</p>
